My name is Rachel Chang.
I am majoring in Computer Science.
I am from Southern California. I love running, coding, eating
food and taking naps. I served a mission in Taipei, Taiwan. My father is Chinese and my mom is American.
 I love coding because I think it is amazing that I could learn a new language and then suddenly what I write comes to life. It gives new meaning to the <b>pen is mightier than the sword</b>. Except in my case the pen is a keyboard.
If there were one thing I could change about the world, it'd be that everyone knew and applied the gospel in their lives. The gospel gives so much <i>happiness and meaning to life</i> when applied to our lives.
It is the <i>most beautiful thing</i> to be a witness of the change that occurs when the gospel is applied to others lives.
I think it would solve all the world's problems because we would all be striving to be like <b>Christ</b>. And when all people are striving to be like <b>Christ</b> all the major problems in the world would be solved.
